Development
===========

This details the development of EcoTrackr- The features that have been added and those chosen against due to restrictions.

* A working and cohesive front end design was though out and planned along with usability choices made and industry standards followed.

* The issue of back end development and validation has been solved through the use of a Virtual Private Server which is hosted and running giving us access to a great amount of backend features. We currently use this for storage and other data validation.

* A Login page has been fully implemented, however we have chosen to disregard validation using authorization tokens.

* API routing has been added to the backend and continues to be tweaked upon.

* We have opted to further disregard features regarding the leaderboard and its associated features. However a front end version will still be available with no functionality.

* Continous tweaks are made to the front end side of the application as the team constantly conforms to industry standards.
