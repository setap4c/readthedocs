Feature Development Justification
===========

1. The choice to disregard validation of logins using Authorization tokens was made as we realized that a large sink of time and effort was being put into the login page and we needed to get on the move with core features and their implementation. The team decided to validate users using their IDs instead of the tokens.\
2. The choice to disregard the implementation of a leaderboard was made due to time constraint; We realized that the implementation of core features should be our number one priority, We may revisit this if we have time.
